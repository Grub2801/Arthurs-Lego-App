# Arthur's Hyper Lego App
(his name choice not mine)

Just a bit of fun. My 6 year old currently likes to make bizare Lego minifigure creations so we decided to create an app that would keep a record of his wonderful immagination.

It also helps me refresh my memory of how to build a very simple Ruby on Rails application.

We are supposed to be building this app together...

Wish me luck x
